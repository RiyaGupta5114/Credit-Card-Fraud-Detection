# Credit-Card-Fraudulent-Transaction-Detection-Model

# Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. It employs a Logistic Regression model trained on a balanced dataset to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent. A Streamlit-based web app is also developed to provide real-time fraud detection.

# Features

Data Preprocessing: Balanced the dataset using undersampling to handle class imbalance.

Model Training: Implemented a Logistic Regression model to classify fraudulent transactions.

Performance Evaluation: Achieved high accuracy using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

Web App Integration: Built an interactive Streamlit application for real-time fraud detection.

# Technologies Used

Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Streamlit)

Machine Learning: Logistic Regression for classification

Web Application: Streamlit for real-time user interaction

# Model Training & Evaluation

Preprocessing: Removed class imbalance using undersampling techniques.

Training: Implemented Logistic Regression for fraud detection.

Performance Metrics: Evaluated accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Web App Usage

Enter transaction details in the Streamlit web interface.

Click Submit to get a real-time fraud prediction.

The app displays whether the transaction is legitimate or fraudulent.

# Future Enhancements

Implement deep learning models (Neural Networks, Autoencoders) for fraud detection.

Deploy the model as an API for seamless integration with financial systems.

Enhance feature engineering techniques to improve fraud detection accuracy.
